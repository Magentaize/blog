- A self-driven vector sensor based on BB-TENG is constructed to measure rotation angle and direction in real time.
- The impact of rotor-stator area ratio on the output of TENG was investigated and an algorithm was proposed.
- Speed monitoring with an absolute error of no more than 0.2 rpm is achieved by BB-TENG.
- A passcode dialer is designed based on BB-TENG, which provides enhanced method of authentication against replay attacks.
