Overhead transmission lines are susceptible to ambient wind and can be easily damaged by it. In order to monitor the breeze vibration on the transmission line, a self-powered wind sensor based on triboelectric nanogenerator (WM-TENG) is proposed in this paper, which can realize real time monitoring of the wind speed and direction that cause breeze vibrations. A non-contact design with a sponge is used to avoid the abrasion of contact-induced material during movements and to compensate for the dissipation of electrical charges. When the wind direction is within the monitoring range, the intermediate voltage value appears. It can determine whether the wind direction is within the monitoring range. Combined with our programmable software, the fabricated monitoring system based on WM-TENG realizes the statistics of aeolian vibration time acting on overhead transmission lines.
