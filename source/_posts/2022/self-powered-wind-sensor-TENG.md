- In order to monitor the breeze vibration on transmission lines, a self-powered sensor based on dual-mode TENG is proposed.
- A non-contact design is used in the fabricated WM-TENG to reduce the abrasion and to compensate for charge dissipation.
- Feasibility of WM-TENG is verified by variable wind speed and direction tests.
- A self-powered breeze vibration timing system based on WM-TENG is demonstrated through a programmable software platform.
